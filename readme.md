# Problem 
- if you're reading a longform article on a website, you can't bookmark within the text, just like putting down a regular newspaper
- we shouldn't mandate that longform articles should be app-based 
- as a solution we want an tool to bookmark your position to come back to later 

# Solution 
Bookmark tool for 
- anyone who has a website and is able to control their codebase 
- anyone who wants to give readers the ability to bookmark an HTML page

## Known Issues 
On the older Android stock browser, click events fire when scrolling

## Roadmap Ideas 
- UI
-- smooth scrolling
-- onboarding function e.g. append Save My Spot to viewport bottom
-- “favourites” page to collect saved spots from multiple stories
- Personalisation / User Preferences
-- set / clear localStorage via icons in My Placeholder menu
--  behaviour of page on-reload 
- Share saved spots across multiple devices 
-- Pocket for personal use (Sense Checking) 
-- send saved spots to other users 
- Publisher-friendly
-- Add Save My Spot to any Webpage with a single line of JavaScript (like Google Analytics)
